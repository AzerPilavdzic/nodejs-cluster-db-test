# Node â€“ MongoDB Replica Set Demo

A simple Dockerized Node.js app that inserts a new document into a 5-node MongoDB replica set every second to demonstrate replication and automatic failover.

## Run the project

```bash
docker compose up
```

The app will start inserting data into MongoDB once a PRIMARY node is elected.

## Test failover

Stop the current primary (e.g., mongo1) and watch another node take over:

```bash
docker stop mongo1
docker exec -it mongo2 mongosh --eval 'rs.status().members.map(m=>({name:m.name,stateStr:m.stateStr}))'
```

The Node.js app will keep inserting automatically into the new PRIMARY.

## Remove all data and replica-set config (clean reset)

```bash
docker compose down -v
```
